# Weather-Dashboard

#User Story 

AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

#Acceptance Criteria 
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

Created a dashboard that uses the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data for cities that are searched for by user. Uses localStorage to store any cities that have been searched for prior and allows user to call them up quickly.
